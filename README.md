# WebFlux API
## üìù Description
This project was developed during the WebFlux course and is an API developed in Java with Spring WebFlux, aiming to perform CRUD operations on a database table.

WebFlux is a reactive framework that is part of Spring 5 and is an alternative to Spring MVC. It is based on Project Reactor, which is a reactive implementation for Java.
It is suitable for applications requiring high scalability and low latency, such as IoT applications, chat, online games, among others.
Being non-blocking, it is capable of handling a large number of simultaneous requests with fewer threads, making it more efficient.
